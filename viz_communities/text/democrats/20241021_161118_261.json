  "text": "I made calls yesterday for almost 3 hours. Half of the calls were hang ups but I did reach about 18 actual people who talked for a bit. 10 out of these said they were definitely either voting for Kamala or already have. 1 caller, my favorite one, actually left the call “undecided” but leaning more toward Harris. He’s a guy in his mid-20s from Mississippi originally and works in Atlanta now. We talked for about 30 min while he was driving and I had a genuine connection with him while he was explaining what was most important to him. The economy was a big point, he didn’t like how the top 1% has benefitted from so many policies (Trump’s tax cuts absolutely fueled this). He was also disappointed with the Jan 6 attempted coup and abortion bans in the south. He doesn’t necessarily buy into the “doom and gloom” messaging on the left, which I didn’t want to push because I wanted to keep the convo going, and we left with him leaning less towards trjmp and more undecided but very interested in reading more about each platform. We talked for awhile about my family and situation and what I felt would benefit the middle class by the Harris/Walz plan. Ultimately he’ll make his own decision but I felt so refreshed from this call because he’s in the demographic we all see as “hardcore” trumpies: young white men. I told him to tell all his friends to vote and he was eager to do so. I felt like if this was a troll, our call would not have lasted so long (27 min!). If you can, please volunteer to phone bank. There are a lot of people who hang up or are rude and that’s fine. I got this one caller and 10 others who gave me SO much hope. Let’s win this and reach the hearts and minds of all the regular Americans who are tired of trump and the GOP!!!\n\n",
