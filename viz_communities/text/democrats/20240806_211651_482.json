  "text": "This is the first time in months that I genuinely feel optimistic about US politics, before my mindset was kinda \"I don't like Biden much but I'm gonna keep him out because I despise Trump\" and I think that was a lot of people's mindset (especially since I consider myself more left wing than the average Democrat) and I even planned to leave the country if either of them won. But now that it's Kamala as the nominee, my attitude is that I'm perfectly content with voting for her, in fact, I am Proud that my first vote in a presidential election will go towards Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, granted I still plan to prepare to leave the country, get my passport, visa, etc. But basically my plan now is I'm gonna do stuff to prepare, but if Kamala wins I can chill here longer, get my degree probably you know, all that good stuff. But I am actually very optimistic about this election (although we should never be cocky or let our guard down) anybody else kinda feel this way?",
