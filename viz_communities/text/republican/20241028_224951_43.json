  "text": "I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!",
