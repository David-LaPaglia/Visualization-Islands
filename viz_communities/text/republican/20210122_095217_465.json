  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nim sitting over here in Europe (Italy) and I am just amazed how the media changed it's attitude towards the US in a matter of days!\n\nThe last 4 years they didnt write anything good about the US, about President Trump or about the Republican Party. And on inauguration day there were like hundrets of articles how good this is for the world, how Biden is the saviour of western civilization and that all Problems will be gone soon.\n\nWhere did investigative journalism go? The whole media apparatus is purely political nowdays. They dont care about the Hunter Biden story for example but as soon as Trump misspells a word they go craaazy.\n\nThe media is acting like a child who finally got their toy they wanted for so long.\n\nIt is disgusting! And the sad thing is we cant do nothing about it.\n\nThe media is the real Enemy of the 21st century! Not just in the US, but in the entire world!\n\nPS: sorry for my rant... just wanted to let off some steam",
