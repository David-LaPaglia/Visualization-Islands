Handed them out and put some in prominent places.\n\nRemoved a bunch of Trump signs that had been placed in concrete cracks on the median of an interstate, too close to the road.\n\nGot poison ivy multiple times in this journey and multiple cracked windshields.\n\nAttended a rally.\n\nBought merch for friends and family.\n\nSpent hours debunking claims on Rumble and Truth.\n\nManaged to get the Dilbert guy to read a pro-Kamala message on his Rumble pod.\n\nDonated to the campaigns.\n\nWore my Kamala camo hat around Florida and North Carolina.\n\nIt was a tough fight, gave it a good try.",
