  "text": "So obviously as the title reads, I am a democrat and I've been reading the posts you guys put up here. With the election going on I figured I would try and get a perspective from the other side. I would like to say that the vast majority of you all seem like great people. I know that Reddit leans so far left that it might fall off the edge of the internet eventually, so I understand how being republican/conservative on this app can be frustrating. I actually agree with a lot of the points and arguments you guys make, I do disagree with some, but not nearly as many as I thought I would. I just think that it's the far extremists on both sides that are making everything seem so damn polarized right now. In reality, I bet 95% of us want similar things, but the media makes it seem as though we are polar opposites. I'm not sure about you all but I am tired of all of this. I am tired of the hate from the extremists on both ends, I'm tired of the politics smothering social media platforms, I am tired of this awful tension in the air all the time, and I am tired of being told that other Americans are my \"enemy\". I want to feel united as a country, not divided. After reading a ton of posts here over the past two days it seems like a lot of you all feel the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: I would like to say that the overwhelmingly large amount of positivity in the comments is great to see. Also, I know it's not a lot of upvotes so far but it's the most I've ever received on Reddit so thank you all so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Thank you all for the awards, I feel like I need to prepare a speech or something. But as I mentioned before, all the messages and comments that I have seen so far have been nothing but overwhelmingly positive. It gives me a lot of hope for the future. ",
