  "text": "I need somewhere to share this because I can’t do it to my liberal family or friends but I’ve finally become a republican. The past four years and surrounding uproar throughout and after the election has made me realise how flawed and straight up wrong the Democratic Party is. I had been brainwashed by my Californian surroundings that trump was pure evil but really when you take out that left bias, it’s clear he made America great again. I regret not voting for him and being blind and robotic with my vote. I know from now I’ll be red politically and keep frankly I’m ashamed to have been brainwashed for so long but thankfully I can stand here and say I’m a republican.",
