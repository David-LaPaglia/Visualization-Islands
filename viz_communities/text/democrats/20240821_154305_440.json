  "text": "\nThis is my husband. He is a Gulf War veteran. He worked 12 hours today as a mechanic (like he does every day). He came home, ate dinner, drank a beer, and helped me pack a few more boxes for our upcoming move out of this shitty apartment where we have lived for the last five years because housing is so freaking expensive where we live. (Obligatory fuck you to the greedy property management corps and Air BnBs who own goddamn everything around us). He is still wearing his dirty work uniform and is so tired that he hasn’t even showered yet because our work isn’t quite over for the day. He is taking a quick break to watch a few of the speeches before getting back to the task. He doesn’t complain though. No, he just does what he needs to do and then tomorrow he will wake up and start all over, all with kindness in his heart and a positive attitude. He is my rock. He is also tearing up watching Michelle and Barack Obama speaking last night. Those are happy tears. Tears of relief. Hope is such a powerful emotion. My husband the veteran doesn’t want Traitor Trump to ever get near the White House again and he is so tired of the GOP and their negativity, fascist tendencies, and deeply skewed version of “patriotism.” My man is a hard working patriot and is voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. \n\n Y’all…LET’S DO THIS! #YesWeCan! #Harris/Walz2024 #VoteBlue ",
