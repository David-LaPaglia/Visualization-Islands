  "text": "If this does not belong here I truly apologize 🙏🏻\n\nMy mom and I are kind of in a heated discussion about, of course, politics. She’s reposting things on Facebook that essentially accuse the Democratic Party of choosing our candidate for us and that it’s never been done in the history of the country, yada yada. It seems dangerously close to the “Kamala did a coup!!!!!!” argument I see a lot online.\n\nMy question is, how exactly does the Democratic Party (and the other one too, I suppose) choose a candidate? I’m not old enough to have voted in a lot of elections, just since 2016. But I don’t remember the people choosing Hilary, it seemed like most Dems I knew were gung-ho about Bernie and were disappointed when Hilary was chosen over him. I guess I was always under the impression that we don’t have a whole lot of say in who is chosen as candidate, and I’m just wondering how much of that is true and how much of it is naivety. \n\n(Picture added because it was necessary. Please don’t roast me, I’m just trying to understand)",
