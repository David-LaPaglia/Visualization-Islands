  "text": "Women on the left have been blasting this narrative that a Trump victory is a threat to women’s rights. The only “right” they’ve indicated being taken away is abortion, which clearly isn’t an issue that the president will even have to address. \n\nThe whole message is that if you vote for Trump you don’t care about women. But as a woman who has a daughter I feel like I HAD to vote Trump to protect rights she has that are much bigger than abortion. Her right to free speech, her right to assemble, to protest, her right to exist as a female in exclusively female spaces like sports and restrooms, to bear arms, her right to a secure border and safe streets, her right to not have gender confusion or mutilation pushed onto her, her right to be educated and raised by her parents and not the government. Most importantly her right to be an innocent child. \n\nIs there something I’m missing? ",
