  "text": "Was a live long republican and even voted for Trump in 2016.  Then his disastrous presidency turned me into a Never Trumper but still republican - even voted for Biden as a Republican.  Then Roe V. Wade got overturned and I changed my party affiliation from R to D.  The Republican Party was no longer the party of small government to me.  Plus I’ve always been socially liberal.\n\nNow watching the DNC, seeing the hope and true joy and energy the base has.  I freakin’ love it.  It feels good to be part of this.  Michelle’s speech was amazing and Obama’s speech is going strong right now.\n\nMy choice has even affected my kids as they are seemingly more openly liberal now.\n\nJust wanted to say: I’m proud to say my party affiliation without the need to have to defend it with technicalities that I felt I had to before.  I’m a democrat now.  The reason: because I have a heart and want to do what’s right.  Simple enough and the truth.",
