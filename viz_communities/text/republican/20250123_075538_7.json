I am just so tired of it.. I used to look at reddit for memes but now all people post is just some dumb bs about Trump or Elon. Im just glad Trump won and is able to actually get some stuff done while we have the house and senate. I just wanted to post this somewhere I know I wouldn't just get banned immediately. \n",
