  "text": "We are happy to have guests, however our users hear your arguments all the time, we don't need you to come here and tell us your arguments. If you find yourself not hearing our arguments, consider that before you call us the ones living in an echochamber. You had to seek us out to find out about our views, you had to change your regular behavior to hear views unlike your own. We don't have to do that, we hear your arguments literally all the time.\n\nThink very hard about that.\n\nMany of you mean well and are seeking real conversation. There are places for that where many of our users frequent. The debate subs, the ask-a-_______ subs, the change-my-mind subs. This sub is for us. If you can't respect that, even if you are seeking out honest conversation, then you are being disrespectful. The purpose of our sub is for us to talk about the day's events.\n\nIf you don't understand this, then you probably won't have a good experience here and it's best to just turn back now and not waste anyone's time.\n\nTo our users: As always, please report users who do not follow our rules.",
