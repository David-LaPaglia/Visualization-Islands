  "text": "I'm a Malaysian, Muslim male. I know,maybe we can't see eye to eye, I know you may have assumptions about me and my religion. All I can say about that is I understand why you have those thoughts, I do too, my Catholic filipino family probably does too but thank God they love me. All I want to say is, the left always talk about love and peace, but they continue to show hypocrisy and demonize anyone in disagreement with them. I've seen too much violence coming from them, too much hate and illogical points. All I see in the right is people protecting american values, I don't see racism, I don't see hate. PragerU was probably my convincing point. So if I was to choose a friend, I'd choose a right wing person, just because they won't continue to shove their ideas down my throat and force me to think like them. I know we don't see eye to eye, were both ignorant, I hope we can accept that and accept each other while respecting each others values. Peace be upon you.",
