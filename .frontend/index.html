      <p>Research Focus: This study investigates how the hosting site impacts the accessibility and usability of COVID-19 visualizations.</p>
      <p>Challenge: Visualizations are often isolated by the accessibility and performance limitations of the hosting websites.</p>

      <h2>Original Research Questions</h2>
      <p>
        <p>1. How effective is a visualization that is specifically for accessibility if it is hosted on an inaccessible website?</p>
        <p>2. How valuable are visualization tools for the web if they are hosted on websites that take minutes too cumbersome for many people to access?</p>
        <p>3. How do hosting site accessibility and performance affect the usability of public health visualizations for diverse user groups?
        </p></p>
    <h2>Goal: </h2>
    <p>Identify barriers and propose solutions to enhance accessibility and usability for diverse users.</p>
    <h2>Motivation / Background</h2>
    <p>Widespread Accessibility Issues: 96.3% of top websites fail to meet accessibility standards (WebAIM, 2023).</p>

    
    <p>Digital Divide: 23% of U.S. adults lack broadband, with rural and low-income groups facing greater access challenges (Pew, 2021).</p>

    <p>Only 57% of households earning under $30,000 have broadband, compared to 92% of higher-income households (Burrel, 2018).</p>
    
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        If similar barriers hold for websites that host important public data
        visualizations, then the design of our charts may act as visualization
        islands - data portraits that are inaccessible due to their technical
        context, regardless of how compelling, accessible, or well-crafted the
        visualization itself is designed.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>Dataset: COVIC Archive – Over 3,000 COVID-19 visualizations from various sources (news, social media, peer-reviewed studies).</p>
    <p>Accessibility Assessment: WebAIM’s WAVE API – Analyzed 3,136 sites for accessibility issues, identifying types and frequency of WCAG failures.</p>
    <p>Performance Assessment: WebPageTest – Collected load time data across different connection types (3G, DSL, FIOS).</p>
    <p>Methodology: Combined automated accessibility and performance analysis to evaluate technical barriers in accessing COVID-19 visualizations.</p>
