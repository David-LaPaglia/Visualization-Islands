  "text": "I just need to rant and apologize to everyone thatâ€™s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, Iâ€™m proud to say Iâ€™m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was Americaâ€™s savior, and Iâ€™m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me sheâ€™s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Canâ€™t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , letâ€™s go Harris Walz ðŸ’™",
