Thankfully we live in a very blue state but wtf can I do - what can WE ALL do - to prevent the most minimal amount of damage done to our already fragile democracy? \nI'm not involved in politics, I don't have a large platform, I'm only one person...but how can we keep ourselves safe while also helping prevent the death of democracy? I'm sad and frustrated and lost and I don't know what to do to fight back. Is there any point?",
