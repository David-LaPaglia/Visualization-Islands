  "text": "I have historically been a “best person for the job” voter, not loyal to any party. But Trump has so corrupted the Republican Party that I cannot believe any candidate with an R by their name can be trusted to abide by our nation’s laws and govern in a moral, respectful manner. I stuff in line for an hour voted early in Tennessee (with my wife) and hope my vote can do some good to stop the literal insanity that is degrading American politics at all levels of our government.\nPlease vote!",
