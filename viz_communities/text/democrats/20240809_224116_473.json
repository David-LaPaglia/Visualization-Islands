  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI lean conservative but respect everyone’s position of course on who they want to vote for. Only way to understand each other more is by asking questions. Not fighting.\n\nI am asking this question with genuine curiosity not hostility. \n\nI can understand not liking Trump but what do you see in Kamala other than the fact she isn’t Joe Biden and she isn’t Trump? What do you think she would do for this country?",
