  "text": "\"nO oNe VoTeD fOr HaRrIs\" I DID. I was registered for the Democratic primary in my state, I checked the box for Joe Biden, I was informed enough to know that was short hand for the Biden/Harris ticket. With the President's advanced age I was aware that there was a greater than average chance that Harris would step up into that role, and I was comfortable with that ticket. I voted for the ticket with Harris on it in the primary, I'll vote for the ticket with Harris on it for the election. No problem seen.\n\nI know that the 'no one voted for Harris' argument isn't legitimate, it's just the other side of the aisle trying to invent a wedge issue to break down Democratic support. They're all pointless, bad faith arguments, this one just gets under my skin. No matter how many tactics the GOP try, I will be in that voting booth on election day, and I will be voting for any Democrat, and if that Democrat is Kamala Harris, it will be pleasure vote, and not only a necessity.",
