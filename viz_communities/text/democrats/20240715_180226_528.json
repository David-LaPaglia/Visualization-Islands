  "text": "America, this is not gonna be easy to accept; but, as someone who *survived* an *attempted murder* at the hands of an **abusive, malignant narcissist**: *you're in an abusive relationship*  \n\ni **understand** the constant gaslighting is exhausting. \n\ni **understand** it's infuriating that his enablers make excuses for him.  \n\ni **understand** it's heartbreaking when everyone around him ignores everything they see and hear and pretend nothing happened.   \n\ni **understand** a new set of rules seems to be invented just for him, and him *only*.\n\ni **understand** its triggering to keep being told you're \"overreacting\".\n\ni **understand** how it feels to be told that *you're* the problem, and that *you* made him hurt you by not just letting him \"blow off steam\"\n\ni **understand** his enablers are just as terrified of him, and that's why they keep supporting him.  \n\ni **understand** when the courts keep giving him another chance to come back and finish the job.  \n\ni **understand** the constant feelings of impending doom everytime he's present\n\ni **understand** feeling isolated and questioning yourself and wondering if everyone else is right when they say you're just \"being too sensitive\" and reduces everything he does into a \"joke\" that you \"misunderstood\" \n\ni **understand** never being able to hide from or avoid him.   \n\ni **understand** losing friends and family because he keeps lying to them and you can't change their minds, even when you show them the receipts. \n\ni **understand** because i *survived* it.  \n\nBut America, all is **not lost** and you are **not** crazy. Everything you feel is valid. Everything you have experienced **really did happen to you**. you **will** come out of this stronger, happier and better. \n\nI know that seems impossible to even imagine right now. i know you feel lost and defeated, but i promise you are not alone. i know it's terrifying to think about and predict his reaction based on all the times you tried to get out of this relationship, but *you have to cut all ties with him*. you have to get him out of your house. you have to pile all his crap on the curb. you have to change the locks. you have to block all contact and refuse to listen to anyone who advocates for him. but, you **can** escape him.     \n\nAmerica, you **have to vote** and you **have to vote for Joe Biden**. that's the *only* way you **survive** this abusive relationship. **you're not a victim America, you're a survivor** never forget that.  \n\nWith love and compassion,  \nA concerned citizen",
