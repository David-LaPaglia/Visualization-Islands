  "text": "\nIn the past few weeks I’ve had several conversation with Republicans I have known for years and some for just a week or two. \n\nThese are the topics that are changing minds:\n1. Mass Deportation: Even my MAGA mom doesn’t want to see her Vietnamese hairstylist or her Chinese Oncologist deported. I could make no headway with mom for almost a decade but I have finally broken through and mom brought dad with her.\n2. Retirement Benefits: My second cousin is a retired colonel and a major Republican. I showed him how Project 2025 is planning to take away his inflation adjusted benefits. He was understandably pissed.\n3. Supreme Court placing the President above the law: At least some of the MAGA really don’t like that because it is clearly unconstitutional even to the 2a worshipers.\n\nLet’s be clear these are all Republicans. A vote away from R and one more vote for D.\n\nMaybe we start talking to our family, friends and acquaintances about what the future holds if Rs win in November? \n\nIMHO I think the media is afraid Dems will win. I don’t believe corporate polls. What I see in my social network points to a blue landslide. If we only all keep working on the people we actually know IRL.",
