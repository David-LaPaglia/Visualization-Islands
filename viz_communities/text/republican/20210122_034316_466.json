We decided that:\n\n[We are unpaid mods and do not owe reddit anything.  We were protecting our regular users from abuse and protecting ourselves...the mods... from having to deal with bullshit when frankly, many of us just wanted to be dedicating OUR time to PRAYING for peace in DC.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9AbeALNVkk)\n\nNot a single person has ANYTHING intelligent to say WHILE a situation is happening.\n\nWe definitely started to see that as users rushed in to try to call us violent traitors.\n\nSo ... we just shut the sub.  \n\nMade it private...and tried to add known users as approved users.\n\nWe reserve our right to do this again in future...because we will NOT be abused.  We will shut that right down.\n\nAgain...we aren't paid and we're not obliged to stay open.\n\nWe tried to add mods.  But conservatives are overwhelmed on reddit by leftists.\n\nThere's NO way to have enough mods to prepare for the lefty hordes to rain down on you like that.\n\nIN SHORT.  \n\nWE WENT PRIVATE.  WE HAD GOOD REASON.  IF ABUSED LIKE THAT WE MAY DO IT AGAIN.\n\nGood to see everyone again.\n\nSorry not sorry for the interruption.",
