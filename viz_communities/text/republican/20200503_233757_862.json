  "text": "Hey guys. I am Black, a teacher, a gun owner and a Christian . I got into reddit for the memes and I quickly realized that reddit is a crazy leftwing echo chamber. People post crazy leftist (wrong) information and will downvote or ban anyone who happens to have a different opinion. I have no karma because I refuse to buy into the crazy. I just wanted to post here in hopes I can get rolling. Epstein didn't kill himself, corona came from china and is not as bad as the msm wants us to think, an unborn baby is a life on its own, if you want health insurance work for it. No one owes you anything, no matter how many likes you get.\n\n\nEdit: Hello my leftist friends. I am a nerd and love Star Trek. Anyone who does not think socialism is a wonderful idea is selfish or just an ass hole. But people are shitty. Not all of them , but most of them. So it will not work because of that. I get it. I left college super brain washed and worked construction for a long time. The whole time I felt cheated because I was doing all the work and the company owner was making the money. \"Nobody cares. Work harder\". What I didn't understand is that the owner also works hard, and was there first. I started working harder and now am in a good place in life. So please before you try to sell me some \" My sales tax on gum is the reason you can have anything\" please understand I have been there. Again \"Nobody Cares. Work Harder\"",
