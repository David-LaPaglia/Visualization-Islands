The US is in a proxy war through Ukraine against Putin's Russia. There is literally no way this would ever be true. Putin understands that the US is trying thwart his overall leadership. We can absolutely thank biden for this. Biden has literally called this man a war criminal.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS DOES NOT SUPPORT PUTIN. I GURANTEE IT!\n\nThe last thing I'll say is this could very well be literal evidence of Russias' attempt at phycology warfare through all internet platforms in real time. My fellow Democrats, ignore this and carry on. We all agree that Putin and Trump got to go. Kamala also understands this. I'm not concerned with her at all. Keep fighting.",
