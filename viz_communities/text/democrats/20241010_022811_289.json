I spent hours on hold with CMS, to just get told I needed to call the CDC.\n\nDuring all of this bullshit, it turns out we never had the machines I needed, because they were getting shipped out to Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nWe were spraying our masks with hand sanitizer, trying to find ways to sanitize gloves sucessfully, literally run to local stores hoping they had medical swabs we could put to use.\n\n\nFuck Donald Trump.
