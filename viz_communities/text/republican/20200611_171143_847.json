  "text": "\n1- Go to BlackLivesMatter.com.\n2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.\n3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).\n4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&cmte=C00401224\n*⬆️ This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.\n5- Click “Expenditures”.\n6- Scroll down until you see “Top Vendors/Recipients”.\n\nSo if for some reason you don’t understand what you’re seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards “Bernie for President” and Biden’s campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!\n\nFeel free to correct me if I missed something...\n\nTaken from Adam Ringham’s FB post\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/679673288/posts/10160187838803289/?d=n",
